### 📚 Homework Help Forums

**#math-homework-help & #cs-homework-help**

#### ✅ How to Ask Great Questions:
1. **Use the right tag** for your course (L1, CS2, AMC10, etc.)
2. **Show your work** - explain what you've tried and where you're stuck
3. **Be specific** - "I don't understand" is less helpful than "I'm confused about why step 3 leads to step 4"
4. **Use threads** for extended discussions to keep the main channel organized

#### ✅ How to Give Great Help:
1. **Guide, don't solve** - help them think through the problem
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - "What do you think happens if...?"
3. **Explain your reasoning** - don't just show the answer
4. **Be encouraging** - everyone struggles sometimes!

#### 🚫 Please Don't:
- Post complete solutions without explanation
- Share homework answers right before deadlines
- Be dismissive of "basic" questions
- Spam or post off-topic content
