# MathSchool Discord Server Setup Guide

## Overview

This repository contains the complete setup guide for the MathSchool Discord server, designed to foster community learning, peer support, and effective class management across all mathematics and computer science courses.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

The server structure balances **community engagement** with **organized learning spaces**, featuring:

- **Shared homework help** to maintain active discussions and cross-level peer learning
- **Private classrooms** for course-specific logistics and casual interaction
- **Global community spaces** to build school-wide connections
- **Role-based access** for streamlined management

### 📘 2. Homework Help (Shared Forums)

**Category**: `Homework Help`

| Channel | Type | Tags Available |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `#math-homework-help` | Forum | `L1`, `L2`, `FunMath1`, `FunMath2`, `AMC8`, `AMC10`, `AMC12`, `AIME` |
| `#cs-homework-help` | Forum | `CS1`, `CS2`, `CS3`, `CS4` |

#### ✅ Why Shared Homework Help Works

**Critical Mass & Activity**
- Prevents individual class channels from becoming inactive
- Ensures questions receive timely responses

- Alumni can remain engaged and support new cohorts
- Builds lasting connections across class years

**Simplified Moderation**
- Teachers monitor 2 channels instead of 20+
- Consistent rule enforcement
- Centralized resource management

**Visibility**: All math/CS students regardless of semester

### 🏫 3. Classrooms (Private Access)

**Purpose**: Course-specific logistics, casual discussion, and class coordination

#### Mathematics Courses
- `#l1-classroom`
- `#l2-classroom`
- `#funmath1-classroom`
- `#funmath2-classroom`
- `#amc8-classroom`
- `#amc10-classroom`
- `#amc12-classroom`
- `#aime-classroom`

#### Computer Science Courses
- `#cs1-classroom`
- `#cs2-classroom`
- `#cs3-classroom`
- `#cs4-classroom`

#### Classroom Usage Guidelines
- **Teachers**: Post homework assignments and logistics (use pins for important info)
- **Students**:

### 🎭 5. Role System

#### Student Roles (Semester-Based)
- `2025-CS1`, `2025-CS2`, `2025-CS3`, `2025-CS4`
- `2025-L1`, `2025-L2`
- `2025-FunMath1`, `2025-FunMath2`
- `2025-AMC8`, `2025-AMC10`, `2025-AMC12`, `2025-AIME`

#### Staff Roles (Global)
- `Admin` - Full server management
- `Teacher` - Course instruction and moderation
- `TA` - Teaching assistant privileges
- `Tutor` - Homework help moderation

#### Access Logic
- **Homework Help**: Open to all math/CS students
- **Classrooms**: Restricted by semester-class roles
- **Staff Spaces**: Restricted by staff roles
- **Global Community**: Open to all members
